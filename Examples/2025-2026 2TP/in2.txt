Sir Aldric of the Silver Banner had faced many strange things in his years of service to the realm—dragons with molten breath, sorcerers who bent shadows to their will, and forests that whispered secrets to those foolish enough to listen. Yet none of these compared to the oddity he discovered on the morning the sky turned the color of tarnished steel.

He found it leaning against an ancient oak along the King’s Road: a curious contraption of metal tubes, thin wheels, and a leather saddle perched atop it like a throne for a very small monarch. It had no reins, no hooves, no place for feed or water. And yet, something about it called to him.

Aldric dismounted his warhorse, Bramble, and approached the device cautiously. “What manner of beast are you?” he murmured, circling it. The machine did not answer, though the sunlight glinted off its polished frame as if winking at him.

He touched it. It was warm.

Bramble snorted uneasily.

Aldric felt a strange pull—an instinct, a whisper in the back of his mind urging him to try it. He was not a man prone to whims, but the world had been shifting lately. Magic was thinning, the old creatures retreating, and the kingdom’s borders growing quieter. Perhaps, he thought, the world was offering him something new.

He swung a leg over the saddle.

The machine wobbled beneath him.

He gripped the strange bar at the front.

And then—without warning—it moved.

Aldric lurched forward as the wheels spun, faster and faster, the wind whipping past his ears. He shouted in surprise, then in exhilaration. The road blurred beneath him. The machine responded to the slightest shift of his weight, as if reading his intentions before he fully formed them.

He laughed—a deep, booming sound that startled birds from the trees.

When he finally slowed to a stop, breathless and wide‑eyed, he felt as though he had glimpsed a new kind of freedom. Bramble trotted up behind him, unimpressed.

“Do not look at me like that,” Aldric said, patting the horse’s neck. “You remain my loyal companion. But this…” He glanced at the machine. “This is something else entirely.”

He decided to bring it with him.

By midday, he reached the village of Thornwick, where smoke curled lazily from chimneys and children chased each other between cottages. The villagers stared as he rode in—not on Bramble, but on the strange two‑wheeled device.

“Sir Aldric?” called the baker’s wife, wiping flour from her hands. “What in the Queen’s name is that?”

“A steed of sorts,” he replied, trying to sound dignified despite the wobble in his voice as he dismounted. “A gift from the road.”

The villagers gathered around, poking and prodding the machine. Some whispered that it was enchanted. Others claimed it was cursed. One old man insisted it was a sign of the world ending.

Aldric ignored them all. He had more pressing matters.

He had come to Thornwick because of the rumors—rumors of a creature stalking the nearby woods, stealing livestock and frightening travelers. Though the kingdom had grown quieter, danger still lingered in forgotten corners.

He questioned the villagers, gathered what information he could, and set off toward the forest. Bramble carried his armor and supplies, while Aldric rode the bicycle, growing more confident with each turn of the wheels.

The forest greeted him with cool shadows and the scent of pine. Birds fell silent as he entered. The bicycle’s wheels crunched softly over fallen leaves.

Hours passed.

Then he heard it—a low, guttural growl.

Aldric stopped. The growl came again, closer this time. He dismounted, drawing his sword. The bicycle stood beside him, gleaming faintly in the dim light.

A shape emerged from the underbrush.

It was massive—larger than any wolf, with fur like midnight and eyes that glowed an unnatural green. Its breath steamed in the air. Its claws dug deep into the earth.

Aldric steadied himself. “Easy now,” he whispered, though his heart pounded like a drum.

The creature lunged.

Aldric dodged, rolling to the side. His sword flashed, grazing the beast’s flank. It howled, turning on him with renewed fury.

He fought with practiced skill, but the creature was fast—too fast. It knocked him backward, sending his sword flying. He hit the ground hard, gasping.

The beast advanced.

Aldric’s hand brushed against something metal.

The bicycle.

He grabbed it, lifting it like a shield just as the creature leapt. The front wheel struck the beast’s jaw with a sharp crack. The creature yelped, stumbling. Aldric swung again, using the bicycle like an oversized flail. The beast retreated, snarling.

Then it froze.

Its eyes flicked to the bicycle.

It whimpered.

Aldric blinked. “You fear it?”

The creature backed away, trembling. Then, with a final growl, it turned and vanished into the trees.

Aldric lowered the bicycle, panting. “Well,” he said, “that was unexpected.”

He retrieved his sword and followed the creature’s trail. It led to a clearing where he found something astonishing: a broken collar of iron, etched with runes. A binding spell. Someone had controlled the beast—forced it to attack.

He pocketed the collar and returned to Thornwick, deep in thought.

The villagers hailed him as a hero when he told them the creature was gone. But Aldric knew the truth: the real threat was whoever had bound the beast. Someone with knowledge of forbidden magic.

That night, as he sat outside the inn, the bicycle resting beside him, he felt the weight of the future pressing on his shoulders. The world was changing. Magic fading. New inventions appearing. Old dangers resurfacing.

He ran a hand along the bicycle’s frame.

“Perhaps,” he murmured, “you and I will face them together.”

The machine did not answer.

But in the moonlight, its wheels gleamed like twin shields, ready for whatever lay ahead.

And Sir Aldric, Knight of the Silver Banner, felt something he had not felt in years.

Hope.
